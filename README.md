# Python Workshop
Exercises to present concepts during the Introductory Python Workshop to female students in seventh, eight, and nineth grade.
There are two files, Rock_Paper_Scissors.py and New_Rock_Paper_Scissors.py. On the first one, a more complex beginner project is found. Whereas, on the second one, an easier project is shown. Both can be used for the workshop but depending on the programming skills seen in the attendants. 

## Rock, Paper or Scissors
In this program the user is able to enter the name. Afterwards they can choose their move, either rock, paper or scissors. Then, it is turn for the computer or cpu player to "choose" its move. Subsequently, both moves are compared, for example, rock vs paper or scissors vs scissors, and based on the rules of the game the winner is chosen. Later, a message is printed to indicate who has won. Finally, the user is asked if they want to keep on playing.
